description: Expert knowledge for Azure Quantum development including troubleshooting,
  best practices, decision making, architecture & design patterns, limits & quotas,
  security, configuration, integrations & coding patterns, and deployment. Use when
  using QDK (Python/Q#/OpenQASM), Azure Quantum workspaces, IonQ/Quantinuum/Rigetti
  targets, QIR jobs, or VS Code tools, and other Azure Quantum related development
  tasks. Not for Azure HDInsight (use azure-hdinsight), Azure Databricks (use azure-databricks),
  Azure Machine Learning (use azure-machine-learning), Azure Synapse Analytics (use
  azure-synapse-analytics).

# Azure Quantum Skill

This skill provides expert guidance for Azure Quantum. Covers troubleshooting, best practices, decision making, architecture & design patterns, limits & quotas, security, configuration, integrations & coding patterns, and deployment. It combines local quick-reference content with remote documentation fetching capabilities.

## How to Use This Skill

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: Use the **Category Index** below to locate relevant sections. For categories with line ranges (e.g., `L35-L120`), use `read_file` with the specified lines. For categories with file links (e.g., `[security.md](security.md)`), use `read_file` on the linked reference file

> **IMPORTANT for Agent**: If `metadata.generated_at` is more than 3 months old, suggest the user pull the latest version from the repository. If `mcp_microsoftdocs` tools are not available, suggest the user install it: [Installation Guide](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mcp/blob/main/README.md)

This skill requires **network access** to fetch documentation content:
- **Preferred**: Use `mcp_microsoftdocs:microsoft_docs_fetch` with query string `from=learn-agent-skill`. Returns Markdown.
- **Fallback**: Use `fetch_webpage` with query string `from=learn-agent-skill&accept=text/markdown`. Returns Markdown.
