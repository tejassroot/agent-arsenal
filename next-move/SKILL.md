# Next Move (deprecated - now an input to /redteamlead)

> **Category:** `Methodology & Operational Workflows` | **Skill Type:** `Workflow Orchestration & Triage`

`next-move` no longer runs standalone. Its ranked output is now one INPUT that
`/redteamlead` reads before giving a wiki-grounded direction.

For "where do I go next", call `Skill(redteamlead)` instead of this skill directly.

The deterministic ranker stays and is unchanged:
```
python3 scripts/next_move.py --json
```
RTL reads this `--json` output (plus state/loot/Killchain/log and the wiki) to produce
its ranked directions. Nothing else in this file is load-bearing anymore.
